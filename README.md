d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

Steps:
1. Invite Collaborator: Go to your repository settings on GitHub (or whichever platform you're using) and navigate to the "Collaborators" section.
2. Enter Username: Enter the GitHub username or email of the person you want to add as a collaborator.
3. Confirmation: The person will receive an email notification or GitHub notification about the invitation. They need to accept it to become a collaborator.
4. Once they accept the invitation, they'll have access to the repository based on the permissions you've granted them.   

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, 
while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud.

f. What does git diff do?
git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function on Git data sources.
These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more.


g. What is the main branch?

the main branch typically serves as the primary branch in a repository. 
It often contains the latest stable version of the project's code and serves as the base for development work.


h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, it's not recommended to push changes directly to the main branch. It's preferable to follow a workflow that involves creating separate branches for new features, 
bug fixes, or other changes, and then merging those branches into the main branch once they are tested and ready.
