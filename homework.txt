git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function on Git data sources.
These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more.


g. What is the main branch?

the main branch typically serves as the primary branch in a repository. 
It often contains the latest stable version of the project's code and serves as the base for development work.


h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, it's not recommended to push changes directly to the main branch. It's preferable to follow a workflow that involves creating separate branches for new features, 
bug fixes, or other changes, and then merging those branches into the main branch once they are tested and ready.
